Certainly! Here's an example of file contents using code blocks:

*Python Code File (example.py):*
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John")
```

*JSON Configuration File (config.json):*
```json

  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password123"
  },
  "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
}
```
